Paragraph:
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both aim to ensure that an application or software continues to function under varying conditions. Service workers enable a website to operate smoothly even without network connectivity, which is a form of graceful degradation. When users encounter situations like no internet access, the service worker plays a crucial role in maintaining website functionality. Thus, both concepts work together to ensure that users have a reliable and usable website, regardless of external conditions.
